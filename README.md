This project seeks to identify health trends from the Big Cities Health Inventory (BCHI). The BCHI is a compilation of health data spanning 53 indicators across 27 major US cities. The original dataset contains 17 variables and 18329 records collected from various sources. The indicators are broken down into 11 categories, including:

1. Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse
2. Cancer
3. Chronic Disease
4. Demographics
5. Environmental Health
6. Food Safety
7. HIV/AIDS
8. Infectious Disease
9. Injury and Violence
10. Life Expectancy/Overall Death Rate
11. Maternal and Child Health

During this exploration, we will reshape the data into 58 variables across 1814 records to allow for multivariate analysis.
